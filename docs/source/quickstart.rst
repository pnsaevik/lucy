Quick Start
===================

The package ``lucy`` consists of several tools that can be used independently,
all related to salmon lice research at IMR. They are designed so that the
inputs and outputs of each tool are compatible.

A short description of each tool is given in the API reference for
:py:mod:`lucy.tools`.
